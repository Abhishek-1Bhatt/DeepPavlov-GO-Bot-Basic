# DeepPavlov-GO-Bot-for-weather-with-RASA-DSLs

As of now the bot is capable of responding to very basic chat functiolity like, greet, thanks and goodbye. These functionalities were achieved by providing DeepPavlov with RASA version 1 type data which is written in specific DSLs. Much smarter interactions can be achieved with the DSTC2 DSLs when used with DeepPavlov.
