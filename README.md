# DeepPavlov-GO-Bot-for-weather-with-RASA-DSLs

As of now the bot is capable of supporting very basic chat functiolity like, greet, thanks and goodbye. These functionalities were achieved by providing DeepPavlov
with RASA version type data which is written in a specific DSL. Much smarter interactions can be achieved with the DSTC2 DSLs when used with DeepPavlov.
